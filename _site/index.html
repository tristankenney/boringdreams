                      <div><p>You know how we have two pieces of cheese?</p>

<p>Well, in the dream, I went out into the lounge room. On the coffee table were five pieces of cheese and I was like “Where did all this cheese come from?”</p>

<p>Then, I walked back into the kitchen and I saw a sixth piece of cheese on the ground.</p>

<p>I picked it up off the floor.</p>

<p>When you have a baby, there is a service you can get where they will drop off clean nappies, and pick up the dirty ones.</p>

<p>I organised it for us, and thought ”<a href='https://twitter.com/YouSaySam'>Sam</a> and Andrew<sup>1</sup> have babies too”.</p>

<p>So I organised it for them as well.</p>

<p>Gen couldn’t find anything to eat. “What about this?”, I asked. “Nah” she responded. “What about this?”, I asked again. “Nah” she responded.</p>

<p>Tom picked up a pasta with a cream and tomato sauce with seafood in it.</p>

<p>Mum got really mad.</p>

<p>“We’re travelling, and he’s eating seafood and we’re not near the ocean yet.”</p>

<p>When I got back to mum’s I thought there was a spider on the wall. There wasn’t actually a spider though. Then I looked again, and there was an actual spider and it was coming for Gen. I yelled “Gen the spider’s coming for you”, and it chased her into the closet.</p>

<p>Then mum came in and killed the spider.</p>

                      <div><p>We went away with Teams<sup>1</sup> for the weekend. When we got home one of the mothers called, to tell me, to remind you, to be careful in the shower because she’d cleaned the tiles on the ground with Windex and it would be slippery.</p>

<p>But I didn’t want to answer the phone, so I had to rush to tell mum that “I already overheard the message, I don’t need to talk to her on the phone”.</p>
<hr />
<p>I told my mum she should watch Breaking Bad, but she said she’d already seen half of it and said something about Jesse being Walt’s boyfriend. I told her that I know that a lot of people had been saying that, but I don’t think that he is.</p>

<p>She then said “I am the one who knocks”, but in a real <em>mumsy</em> voice, but I was <strong>still</strong> impressed.</p>
