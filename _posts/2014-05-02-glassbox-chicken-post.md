title: Glassbox Chicken
---

I was eating chicken but it was cooked on sticks in this glass box thing so I don't think that's boring.

I think we were in the desert or forest or outback or something.

Also some kind of dessert thing that had popcorn chicken in peanut butter and I was like, "yes please!"
