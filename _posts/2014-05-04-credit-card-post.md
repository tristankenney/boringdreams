I dreamt that I went to the shops and then I went to pay and couldn't find the card. But then I looked again, and it was behind another card.

When I got back to mum's I thought there was a spider on the wall. There wasn't actually a spider though. Then I looked again, and there was an actual spider and it was coming for Gen. I yelled "Gen the spider's coming for you", and it chased her into the closet.

Then mum came in and killed the spider.
