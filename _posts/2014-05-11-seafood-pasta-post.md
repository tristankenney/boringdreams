We were all looking for something to eat.

Gen couldn't find anything to eat.
"What about this?", I asked. "Nah" she responded.
"What about this?", I asked again. "Nah" she responded.

Tom picked up a pasta with a cream and tomato sauce with seafood in it.

Mum got really mad.

"We're travelling, and he's eating seafood and we're not near the ocean yet."
