title: Leftovers / Cool Bike
---
I dreamt that I accidentally washed last night's leftovers down the sink and there was only one burger left, which was yours. 

So I ate the skinny, flat cast-offs that weren't really proper burgers. 

And I was a little disappointed but didn't really mind.

I dreamt that to thank Leash<sup>1</sup> for something, I wanted to buy her a present. 

There was a really cool bike I was looking at, but I ended up buying her a chihuahua. 

She said she liked the bike until she saw the dog, and she was happy with my choice.
