So at work at arts house they call the coloured cellophane covers for lights "gels". So I dreamt that I was with gen at the Next Wave bump in, and there were these light globes filled with actual gel. And I thought, "huh, I guess that's what they mean when they call them gels" and then I told gen that's what they were as if I'd known all along
