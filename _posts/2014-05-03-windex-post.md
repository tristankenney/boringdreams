title: Windex / Breaking Bad
---

We went away with Teams<sup>1</sup> for the weekend. When we got home one of the mothers called, to tell me, to remind you, to be careful in the shower because she'd cleaned the tiles on the ground with Windex and it would be slippery. 

But I didn't want to answer the phone, so I had to rush to tell mum that "I already overheard the message, I don't need to talk to her on the phone".

I told my mum she should watch Breaking Bad, but she said she'd already seen half of it and said something about Jesse being Walt's boyfriend. I told her that I know that a lot of people had been saying that, but I don't think that he is.

She then said "I am the one who knocks", but in a real *mumsy* voice, but I was **still** impressed.
