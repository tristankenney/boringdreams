You know how we have two pieces of cheese? 

Well, in the dream, I went out into the lounge room. On the coffee table were five pieces of cheese and I was like "Where did all this cheese come from?"

Then, I walked back into the kitchen and I saw a sixth piece of cheese on the ground. 

I picked it up off the floor.
